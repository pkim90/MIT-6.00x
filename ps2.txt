#problem 1

#Not much to it, just find out if you can buy x number of nuggets using multiples of 
#6, 9, 15.

#problem 2

#If it is possible to buy x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+5 sets of nuggets for some x, then
 it is possible to buy any number of nuggets >=x, as long as nuggets come in 6,
9, 20.

#Why does that work? I have no clue. Sorry.


If it is possible to buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
packs.
Problem 2.
