#problem 1

#Not much to it, just find out if you can buy x number of nuggets using multiples of
#6, 9, 15.

#problem 2

Hypothesize possible instances of numbers of McNuggets that cannot be purchased
exactly, starting with 1
For each possible instance, called n,
Test if there exists non-negative integers a, b, and c, such that
6a+9b+20c = n. (This can be done by looking at all feasible
combinations of a, b, and c)
If not, n cannot be bought in exact quantity, save n
When you have found six consecutive values of n that in fact pass the test of
having an exact solution, the last answer that was saved (not the last value
of n that had a solution) is the correct answer, since you know by the
theorem that any amount larger can also be bought in exact quantity



#If it is possible to buy x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+5 sets of nuggets for some x, then
 it is possible to buy any number of nuggets >=x, as long as nuggets come in 6,
9, 20.

#Why does that work? I have no clue. Sorry.


If it is possible to buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
packs.
Problem 2.
Explain, in English, why this theorem is true.
